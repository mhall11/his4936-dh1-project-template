# Problems and Possibilities

This section serves as your sort-of conclusion/summary. Not a summary of the historical subject, but a summary of the process of the project itself. By discussing where you hit roadblocks and where you wish you could go if you had more time, you leave future individuals something to build on.

You should talk about where you group encountered the most difficulties. What was the hardest about scraping, or visualizing, or locating historiography? Did you have problems communicating or sharing files on GitHub?

What problems stopped you dead in the water? Did you have to change course mid-project to account for data that you could not get, or was not what you thought?

Moving on from problems, let's the reader on a positive note. What worked best, where did you think the strength of the project was? What were the most useful historical insights? What were the most useful tools?

Finally, think of future attempts to continue this line of research, whether by yourself or others. Where do you want to go with it. What areas do you think could be expanded easily? You can discuss what you wish you could have done but could not due to lack of time/skill/et.c. But, much more than that, what would you suggest would be the most useful thing(s) you think could actually be accomplished in the space of another semester?


### Roadblocks:
- Scraping the Glasnevin PDF
  - The PDF provided by the Glasnevin Trust, which contains the names of 485 people who died during the Easter Rising Rebellion with the ability to add more as they are given the data, was hard to properly scrap and turn into a CSV/Excel file to run through Tableau. We worked with Professor Thomas to find a good program to turn the PDF file into a workable TXT file and ended up using the program Xpdfreader and the EXE tool provided by the company to scrape pdfs and turn them into just the text of the PDF. At first, this seemed to be good enough to run through a code which Professor Thomas created for us to turn the TXT into a workable CSV, but because the records held within the PDF weren't complete and left blank lines which the xpdfreader EXE would not read properly and combine multiple lines. This led to the original code returning errors and not being able to turn the TXT into CSV. Professor Thomas augmented his code to properly turn the TXT into CSV which could then be used for the creation of the Tableau sheet showing the affiliation of those who died during the Easter Rising Rebellion.
- Getting mapping to work in Tableau
  - After reorganizing the information through Openrefine, the dataset was now ready to use in creating the visualization part of our project. Tableau was used for the first attempt in creating any kind of visualization based on the dataset. When creating the map concerning the deaths of people during the Easter Rising of 1916 Tableau was lacking the proper tools. Even though we were able to upload the data, Tableau did not allow us the mapping tools necessary for the type of visualization we were trying to make. There were multiple attempts to upload Dublin map packs to Tableau to support our project but there were too many problems. After spending hours in Tableau, a more simplistic mapping tool was used in the end to make our maps. (Written by Stephen DeCasien)
- Transcribing literature for Analysis
  - Insert the paragraph from Lauren later.
- Changed project idea because of data availability
  - Originally, this project started as a compare and contrast with the effects and outcomes of the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Cuban Revolution, but we realized that this type of a project would be far too much work for the span of time given. This led to us boiling the project to exclusively the Cuban Revolution, but without a proper question. After some time for deliberation, Lauren came up with the idea of reworking the project to look at the effects and causes of the Easter Rising Rebellion, as this was a subject she knew had both digital projects already in existence and plenty of new scholarship as the Centennial was in 2016, two years prior to this project. We all agreed this would be the best plan of action as it gave as a defined position to start from and we would have someone, Lauren, who knew the topic well making the analysis portion easier to manage and correct.

### Possibilities:
Literature Analysis
Better data sources
Political atmosphere
Religious atmosphere
