# Project Background

---

Put a general discussion of your topic here. Don't get into the historiography or scholarship here. Just introduce to your reader what your topic is. What is the 'problem', the 'question', and/or the 'argument'.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historiography you think relates to the topic. You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpretative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

The Easter Rising of 1916 has recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of the failed rebellions attempt to overthrow British rule. The centennial event, celebrated in Ireland, led to many colleges and institutions trying to create digital projects to commemorate the rebellion. There is a myriad of ways in which these projects represent some type of digital scholarship on the rebellion. Some institutions made simple maps and pictures concerning the events surrounding the rebellion while others, collected a massive number of primary sources that have been digitized to be accessed by the public.

Institutions like the Glasnevin Trust and ArcGIS made lists of those who died with additional information for the sake of either just having a comprehensive list or for the sake of creating a tutorial for how to make maps using their program (ArcGIS). Boston College, the National Library of Ireland, and the Irish times created databases for access to literature and speeches related to the Rebellion. The Irish Times shows the importance of the 1916 Easter Rising both contemporary to the Rebellion and now. The Boston College project for the Easter Rising in collaboration with segments of the Irish government and The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, contains the most amount of information in one place along with interviews with historians and with readings of the literature of the Rebellion. The National Library of Ireland has collected the works of the biggest names of the Rebellion and have links to PDF scans of their writings.
